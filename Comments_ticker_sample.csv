Then opec didnt want to drill more oil for the us before (idk if that resolved) so there wasnt as much traffic as there should have been. Then the us (instead of fast tracking drilling rights for the permian basin or fracking ofc) goes to mexico and even venezuala for oil which is not NAT’s normal routes so its hard to get into an established system without offering a severe undercut in labor price /profit margin. All that and then the ceo didnt seem confident about being profitable for the near/mid future, he said wait like 5 years.

NAT had soooo much potential to do genuinely great things but instead the corporatists in europe and the US produced every obstacle imaginable.

SPR has seen a 0% increase since 1983 since the administration fucked the market and dumped the SPR.

There's a common misconception/false narrative circulating that retailers tanked due to people not spending money. I don't want to be repetitive but I do want to clarify:

People are still spending money. Sales aren't decreasing. For example, TGT actually increased Q1 rev Y/Y by almost 10%. They beat rev expectations by almost 3%. I'm not even saying this to be a TGT homer, I'm just saying the narrative of a weakening American consumer doesn't really track with what was seen in Q1. The consumer isn't necessarily weakening from a spending standpoint, but shopping patterns are definitely changing.

&#x200B;

>**Brain Cornell:**  
>  
>Our first quarter results demonstrate the underlying strength of the relationship we built with our guests at a time when our team is working through multiple cost pressures affecting our business. **As expected, our business continued to grow in the first quarter, on top of huge gains a year ago, underlining the resilience of both the consumer** and the ability of our team to serve them. However, due to a host of factors, this **growth was challenged by unusually high costs, resulting in profitability well below what we expected it to be and where we expect to operate over time**.**First quarter comparable sales grew by 3.3% on top of 23% growth a year ago. This marked our 20th consecutive quarter of comparable sales increases**, 11 of those quarters were before the pandemic followed by the rapid acceleration we saw in 2020. **We're also encouraged that traffic continues to fuel our growth, increasing nearly 4% in the quarter, on top of \[17%\] growth a year ago**

The problem isn't that people aren't spending money. It's that operating expenses (primarily freight & transportation) ate into the gross profit margin a lot. Which is a serious problem, don't get me wrong. But revenue is not the issue.

&#x200B;

>**Christina Hennington:**  
>  
>As Brian mentioned, first quarter gross margin performance was well below our expectations. This was driven by a number of factors. **The most impactful of which was softer than expected sales in several categories, resulting in too much inventory in those areas**. As we developed our plans for the quarter, our task was to anticipate how spending would change under circumstances no one had ever seen before given that we were about to compare over 2 years of historically high federal stimulus payments. As such, we relied on numerous forecasts and estimate, both internal and external, to help determine our view for the quarter. Despite this careful approach, **the mix of actual demand materialized differently than we had anticipated**.In addition, **as supply grew and demand shifted away from bigger, bulkier products like furniture, TVs and more, we needed to make difficult trade-off decisions. We could keep this product knowing would sell over time or we can make room for fast-growing categories like food beverage, beauty, and personal care and household essentials**. To preserve the quality of on-shelf presentations and support the guest experience, we chose the latter, leading to incremental markdowns that reduced our gross margin. While these were difficult decisions, we believe they'll pay off in the long term, given that building long-term loyalty remains our top priority.

The problems with Q1 (for both TGT & WMT) essentially boiled down to:

* Consumer shopping behavior changed directions quickly and left TGT with too much inventory & nowhere to store it cheaply
   * Discretionary spending is on the decline, so now these retailers have a surplus of things like TVs, kitchen appliances, furniture, etc
   * That said, food and beverage, beauty, and essentials all saw growth.
* Freight & transportation costs increased significantly very quickly so getting goods where they needed to be ate into profits a lot more than expected
* Cost of labor was higher (this is really the only sticky increased operating expense)","['TGT', 'Y', 'WMT']"

“Hrrr drrr you’re poor if you don’t tip!!” 


Biggest psyop on cucked people ever. 

They have a job. We pay the price they request. They set the prices. We don’t profit from the company. We don’t hire the employees. If you have a concern with your pay, take it up with your boss or find another place to work. Obviously. 

“Oh but they clean up after you and being you utensils and stuff!!” 

Yea. They provided that environment willingly. To make people want to come in and *buy their food/drinks* in the first place. It’s included in the prices that once again, they also set themselves. 

I’d never tip anyone besides my landlord if was a lousy rentoid. Since they actually provide me a roof over my head at a price we agreed upon in an area that pleases me. Because I the renter could have gone with any other option, but no - I chose you. You keep the place in order and allow me a safe and comfortable place to live my life and pursue my passions. Landlords are truly the only ones that deserve a tip, if anything.
